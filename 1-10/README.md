 <h2 id="7">7. Cyborg Data Type Sizes </h2>

You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. In order to accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes the following data types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not have any manuals, so you can’t look up this information. Write a C++ program that will determine the amount of memory used by these types and display the information on the screen.

<h2 id="10">10. Land Calculation  </h2>

In the United States, land is often measured in square feet. In many other countries it is measured in square meters. One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. A square meter is equivalent to 10.7639 square feet. Write a program that computes and displays the number of square feet and the number of square meters ¼ in acre of land. 

Hint: Because a square meter is larger than a square foot, there will be fewer square meters in ¼ acre than there are square feet.
