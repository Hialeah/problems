One gram of fat has 9 calories, so
Calories from fat = fat grams * 9
The percentage of calories from fat can be calculated as
Calories from fat ÷ total calories
Input Validation: Make sure the number of calories is greater than 0 and the number of fat grams is 0 or more. Also, the number of calories from fat cannot be greater than the total number of calories. If that happens, display an error message indicating that either the calories or fat grams were incorrectly entered.

• void getScore() should ask the user for a test score, store it in a reference parameter variable, and validate it. This function should be called by main once for each of the five scores to be entered.
• void calcAverage() should calculate and display the average of the four highest scores. This function should be called just once by main, and should be passed the five scores.
• int findLowest() should find and return the lowest of the five scores passed to it. It should be called by calcAverage, which uses the function to determine one of the five scores to drop.
Input Validation: Do not accept test scores lower than 0 or higher than 100.

Star Search
A particular talent competition has 5 judges, each of whom awards a score between 0 and 10 to each performer. Fractional scores, such as 8.3, are allowed. A performer’s final score is determined by dropping the highest and lowest score received, then averaging the 3 remaining scores. Write a program that uses these rules to calculate and display a contestant’s score. It should include the following functions:
• void getJudgeData() should ask the user for a judge’s score, store it in a reference parameter variable, and validate it. This function should be called by main once for each of the 5 judges.
• double calcScore() should calculate and return the average of the 3 scores that remain after dropping the highest and lowest scores the performer received. This function should be called just once by main, and should be passed the 5 scores.
The last two functions, described below, should be called by calcScore, which uses the returned information to determine which of the scores to drop.
• int findLowest() should find and return the lowest of the 5 scores passed to it.
• int findHighest() should find and return the highest of the 5 scores passed to it.
Input Validation: Do not accept judge scores lower than 0 or higher than 10.

• Any special shipping and handling charges (above the regular $10 rate).
The second function receives as arguments any values needed to compute and display the following information:
• The number of ordered spools ready to ship from current stock.
• The number of ordered spools on backorder (if the number ordered is greater than what is in stock).
• Total selling price of the portion ready to ship (the number of spools ready to ship times $100).
• Total shipping and handling charges on the portion ready to ship.
• Total of the order ready to ship.
The shipping and handling parameter in the second function should have the default argument 10.00.
Input Validation: Do not accept numbers less than 1 for spools ordered. Do not accept a number less than 0 for spools in stock or for shipping and handling charges.

• The number of days spent in the hospital
• The daily rate
• Charges for hospital services (lab tests, etc.)
• Hospital medication charges.
If the patient was an out-patient the following data should be entered:
• Charges for hospital services (lab tests, etc.)
